# stellaris_mod_deploy_action

This is a custom tool to aid in updating Stellaris mods. It only makes sense to use this tool if you structure mods similarly, see below under usage.

This tool uses the Github action functionality to trigger a Python script which bumps version numbers and supported Stellaris version, and also creates a Github release for the mod.

## Basic usage
WIP: How to use and structure mod setup
